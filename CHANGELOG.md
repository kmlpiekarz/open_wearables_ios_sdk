# Changelog

## 0.13.0

* **Sync telemetry**: new `/logs` endpoint integration for initial full sync diagnostics.
  - `historical_data_sync_start` event sent before the first payload with per-type record counts, time range, and device state.
  - `historical_data_type_sync_end` event sent per data type as each completes (fire-and-forget), with record count, duration, success status, and device state snapshot.
  - Device state includes battery level/state, thermal state, low power mode, RAM usage, and foreground/background task type.
  - Types with zero records are excluded from end events.
  - Start event is sent for both fresh and resumed full exports.

## 0.12.0

* **Source device name**: added `name` field to the source object in health data payloads, providing human-readable device identification alongside existing device metadata.

## 0.11.0

* **Smarter token refresh error handling**: token refresh failures are now classified as either `authFailure` (refresh token rejected with 401/403) or `networkError` (timeout, DNS, 5xx). Only genuine auth failures trigger user disconnect — transient network errors during refresh no longer force sign-out, allowing the SDK's retry mechanism to recover automatically.

## 0.10.0

* **Combined payloads**: all health data types are now merged into a single payload per sync round instead of separate requests per type.
* **Interleaved sync**: data is fetched round-robin across all types (newest to oldest) instead of sequentially type-by-type.
* **Streaming JSON serialization**: payloads are serialized directly to the network stream, reducing memory usage from O(n) to O(depth).
* **Token refresh fix**: fixed stale credential being reused across sync rounds after a token refresh — credential is now read fresh from Keychain before each upload.
* **Bearer prefix normalization**: access tokens returned by the refresh endpoint without the `Bearer ` prefix are now handled correctly.
* **Sign-out reliability**: `signOut()` now guarantees state cleanup even if the native call throws.
* **Cleaned up logging**: removed verbose debug logs and all token/credential values from log output. Logs now show only essential sync lifecycle events, payload summaries, and HTTP statuses.

## 0.9.0

* Initial tracked release.
